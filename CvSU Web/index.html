        4. Treat others with respect and dignity, so they will treat you the same way. <br>
        5. When communicating via social media platforms through personal messages always give a greeting first, then immediately state your “intentions”. Avoid sending greetings and then disappearing. <br>
        6. When using the restroom do not knock when there is obviously someone inside. And clean up after using (making sure that the water is clear, mud/dirt staining the floors should be at least washed up) <br>
